- 👋 Hi, I’m Eddie, person in recovery who's found a passion for deep thinking and problem solving. Coding is all of that wrapped into one amazing present.

- 👀 my interests include but are not limited to, writing narratives and poems, playing guitar, hiking, physical fitness and wellness, puzzles, chess, really anything to do with nature, water, or things that allow me to be creative. 

- 🌱 I've realized one thing about coding, I will always be a student. some languages I know include HTML, CSS but I prefer sass, JavaScript absolutely dreadful, python love it, SQL elegant yet dizzying. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing ATM (still new to this)

- 📫 How to reach me 

- 😄 Pronouns: ...

- ⚡ Fun fact: always had difficulty internalizing and ascertaining a deep understanding of math concepts so I decided to build a math engine to help with that. it is under knowledge toolkit in my repos inside of the math folder. knowledge toolkit will be more than just a math engine it's going to be my entire college education modeled with oop principles
